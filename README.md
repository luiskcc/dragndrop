Drag and drop prototype for Sales Pipeline


-Using HTML, CSS and JS Vanilla in VScode

Set up the HTML structure: Create an HTML file and set up the basic structure. Divide the page into 6 columns Prospecting, Qualification, Need Analysis, Proposal, Negotiation y Closing Deal representing each stage of the sales pipeline. You can use

elements with appropriate classes to represent the columns.
Style the columns: Use CSS to style the columns, giving them a distinct appearance and defining their dimensions. You can use flexbox to create a responsive layout.

Add draggable elements: Create draggable elements to represent your sales leads or deals. These could be

elements or any other suitable HTML elements. Add event listeners to make them draggable using JavaScript's Drag and Drop API (dragstart, dragend, dragover, dragenter, dragleave y drop or a library/framework like interact.js or jQuery UI.
Implement the drop functionality: Add event listeners to the columns to handle the drop functionality. When a draggable element is dropped onto a column, update its position and appearance accordingly. You can use JavaScript to handle the drop event and manipulate the DOM.
